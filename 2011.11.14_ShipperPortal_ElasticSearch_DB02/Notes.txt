[SearchEngine].[LoadBoardOperations]

1.) Execution plan blew up, before modifications it was utilizing seeks now it is mainly table scans. Need to rewrite the INSERT into #LoadChangeDetails SELECT
(Utilize CTEs / TempTables to only grab the PKs or clustered index column and then join that back select the other neccessary data.)

[SearchEngine].[GetLoadSummaryUpdates]

1.) Move SET NOCOUNT ON below BEGIN
2.) Add SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED 

[SearchEngine].[InitialLoadSeeding] 

1.) Does this only run one time?

[SearchEngine].[LoadActivity]

1.) Why is this a VARCHAR instead of a decimal / numeric such as in tblMoney?

SearchEngine.ActivityLog_PopulateTotalCostField.sql

1.) Is this suppose to update only the NULL values or all values that match to tblMoney with a loadguid?
