1.) Create index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_UploadImageStaging ON dbo.UploadImageStaging (PaperworkType) INCLUDE (LoadID)

2.) Rewrite view: 
-- Use a CTE to select LoadIds created within 3 years and where the mode is TL
-- Create a second CTE to grab the LoadId, UploadId, and CarrierGuid (join the first CTE to tblLoads on LoadId)
-- Use the second CTE in the SELECT statement of the view to grab the needed values.

I can show you an example if needed.
