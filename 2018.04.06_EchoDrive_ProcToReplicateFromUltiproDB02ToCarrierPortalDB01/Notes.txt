[CarrierPortal].[SeedManagerUserFromUltipro]

1.) Remove the GO on line 24
2.) Add a semicolon before WITH
3.) Use Linked Server [DB02NEW] instead of [BATMOBILE-DB02] (doesn't exist yet but I submitted a DevOps request to have it added.)

SqlJob.CarrierPortalManagerUsersFromUltipro

1.) The job is on DB01, so it shouldn't be located in "Reporting" in SVN. Instead create a folder and add it to svn://svn.echo.com:4345/SQLJobs
2.) The job needs a description
3.) The category should be "Business Ops"
4.) Owner login should be SA
5.) Job should email team distro on failure
