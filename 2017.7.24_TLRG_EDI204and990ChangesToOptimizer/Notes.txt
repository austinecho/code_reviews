Notes

[GetCarrierGuid]
1.) @LoadID needs to be a scalar parameter, not a scalar variable. This way it will get initialized so it can be passed to the SP.
2.) Please join tblCarrierLoads to tblLoads using LoadGUID instead of LoadID (Important for preformance!)
3.) Add SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED
4.) Correct typo in the notes for "Carrier"
5.) Make name of SP more meaningful, such as GetCarrierGuidForLoad
6.) We prefer the casing for reserved words to be consistant (Ex. SELECT, INNER, ON, WHERE, FROM, etc should be captilaized)
7.) There is no need for UPPER in the WHERE clause
-- 8/15
1.) Removed, approved

[procgetLoadTotalWeightByLoadGUID] -- Approved
1.) Rename to GetLoadTotalWeightByLoadGUID
2.) Add SET NOCOUNT ON and SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED after BEGIN
3.) We prefer the casing for reserved words to be consistant (Ex. SUM, SELECT, INNER, ON, WHERE, FROM, CREATE, etc should be captilaized)
4.) Remove GO from the very top
5.) Please add schema for tblLoadItems

[procGetTarpSizeCodeByLoadGUID] -- Approved
1.) Remove "proc" from name
2.) Add SET NOCOUNT ON and SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED after BEGIN
3.) We prefer the casing for reserved words to be consistant (Ex. AND, SELECT, INNER, ON, WHERE, FROM, CREATE, etc should be captilaized)
4.) Remove "EchoOptimizer." (Since we are already in the DB EchoOptimizer, you don't need to specify it)
5.) Remove GO from the very top
6.) Add the alias to LoadGuid in the WHERE clause
7.) Specify full JOIN name (JOIN should be INNER JOIN)

[procSaveCarrierResponseEDI990byLoadID] -- Removed
1.) Does not exist in Dev environement. Has it been removed from project?

[procGetCarrierListForThisLoad] -- Approved
1.) Add modified by, modified date, and modified reason comments at top
2.) Add schemas to tables
3.) Question: Does the IsTLAutoTenderEligible need to be added to the @inSearch Y and T as well or just N?

[Tender.LoadTenderResponse] -- Approved 8/15
1.) Should ReservationActionCode and StatusReasonCode ever be NULL? To my understanding, a record will only be in this table if they respond and therefore should have a ReservationACtionCode and a StatusReasonCode.
2.) What is CreatedBy? A user or application or service? What table does it reference?

[Tender].[LoadTender] -- Approved 8/15
1.) If ModifiedDate and ModifiedBy is NOT NULL, it will need a default constraint because it will not have a value when a record is created in the table. 
************ 2.) isDeclined should be after isTimedOut
UniqueIndex

[dbo].[get204ifActive] -- Approved 8/15

2.) We prefer the casing for reserved words to be consistant (Ex. AND, SELECT, INNER, ON, WHERE, FROM, CREATE, etc should be 
3.) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_LoadTenderResponse_LoadTenderID_LoadTenderResponseID ON Tender.LoadTenderResponse (LoadTenderId, LoadTenderResponseId)
4.) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_LoadTender_IsTimedOut_IsDeclined_LoadGuid_Incl ON Tender.LoadTender (IsTimedOut, IsDeclined, LoadGuid) INCLUDE (LoadTenderId)
5.) Rewrite SP as suggested 
6.) Put in Tender schema
7.) Rename to GetActive204
