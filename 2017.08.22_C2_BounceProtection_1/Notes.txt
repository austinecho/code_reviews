CarrierRepLoadBookLog
1.) Should the Unique Index include BookedOn as well?
2.) What happens if a load changes owners? 
3.) Does the BookedOn value get updated if the load is bounced or always remain as the first time it was booked?
4.) NOT FOR REPLICATION not needed because that table isn't replicated

GetBookedDateByRepGuidAndLoadId
1.) How many times will this be executed?
2.) Create Index History.CarrierRepLoadBookLog
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_CarrierRepLoadBookLog_CarrierOwningRepGuid_LoadId_Incl
ON History.CarrierRepLoadBookLog (CarrierOwningRepGuid, LoadId)
INCLUDE (BookedOn);  

GetTierInfoByOriginDestinationZipAndEffectiveDate
1.) Rewrite SP to find the FileImportId based on OriginZip, DestinationZip, and EffectiveDate. Then find all fields based on FileImportID
(I can assist if needed.)

Integration.GetUserGuidFromClutchId 
1.) Integration.User will never have more than one row with the same ApplicationID, EchoUserGUID, and ApplicationUserID? If that is true, remove the existing Unique Index and create:
CREATE UNIQUE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [UX_User_ApplicationID_ApplicationUserID_Incl] 
ON [Integration].[User] ([ApplicationID] ASC, [ApplicationUserID] ASC)
INCLUDE ([EchoUserGUID]) 

InsertNewRepLoadBookLogEntry
1.) Add SET NOCOUNT ON
