Why is there an SP to TRUNCATE Stage tables but SQL query to TRUNCATE Reference table?

Inserting into Reference.ZipReferenceData table:

Maximum insert commit size: 2,147,483,647... change to 500,000
Rows per batch: 500,000

Use SP for TRUNCATE Reference table



GRANT Execute on three schemas (has Staging, Reference, needs Maintenance)
Add DATAREADER and DATAWRITER (insert to staging)
Change TRUNCATE Reference talbe to SP



Reference.ImportFileType.sql 
- PK needs to be created with a name.
- Should it be auto identity?

 [Staging].[MetroFileImport]
- PK must be named
- Use IDENTITY (1,1)
- Default Constraint must be named

[Staging].[MetroFileImportError]
- PK must be named
- Use IDENTITY (1,1)
- Why did you use VARCHAR(20) for Effect_Date instead of Date?



- Change effective date from datetime to date in table (unless the datetime matters)
- For the "Stage Metro Data" control flow > Data flow task "Populate Staging Error Table" should both be set to 25,000 (rows per batch is not)

When email, alert DBA to shrink transaction log. DB set to full, may grow up to 15 GB.
