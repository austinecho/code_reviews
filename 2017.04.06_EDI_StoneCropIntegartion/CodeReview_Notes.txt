11. Wiki article about naming PKs, FKs
FK to ShipmentID for all tables... how transactional will this be 
How is this being populated, PoNumber, ProNumber, etc
ShipmentMode should reference another table, no text values
Reference data for equip type, accessorial, 

Will there be more reference columns such as BOl, Order, PO, Pro? Seperate table for reference type and value
2 tables reference and one with just shipment id and actual number

What if new notes are being added? Should there be a new table? Overwrite notes? New record for each note?

Does shipmentId mean something along the lines of loadId? Will there only be one shipmentID in Client.Shipment?

[Client].[Shipment]
1.) What are some examples of EquipmentTypes, EquipmentAccessorials, EquipmentTarps? Do they need to be VARCHAR(1000)?
2.) Is VARCHAR(40) enough for EquipmentNotes?
3.) Change PalletStackable to a BIT since it is only true/false.
4.) Does UnitOfWeight need to be VARCHAR(50)?
5.) Does CarrierSCAC need to be VARHCAR(50)?
6.) Does there need to be a modified by / modified date coulmns?
7.) What does CreatedBy map to? What does 1 signify? Application or user or other?
8.) Since this is generic now, is it possible it will be used for a different mode that would require more than four characters?
9.) Will CubicSize or Mix/MaxTemp ever be a decimal? 
10.) Why is BIGINT being used instead of INT? (For the other tables as well)
11.) All columns that use list sepearters viaoltes 1nf and we need seperate that, so create a new table that references shipment ID. [AckNotification] is an example of a column that violates 1nf


[Client].[ShipmentItem]
1.) What are some examples of ItemID?
2.) Should weight be INT or should it be float / decimal? Are you rounding the weight?
3.) Change HazardousMaterial to a BIT since it is only true/false.
4.) I don't see StopPickNumber/StopDropNumber in the table in coord-db.dev.echogl.net\db01 but I see it in SVN.
5.) There can be the same shipmentID multiple times in this table because shipments can have multiple items, correct?
6.) What is ValidStart / ValidEnd?
7.) What does CreatedBy map to? What does 1 signify? Application or user or other?

[Client].[ShipmentReference]
1.) What is the difference between Name and Value? They are both 'TEST' in coord-db.dev.echogl.net\db01 currently.
2.) What is ValidStart / ValidEnd? 
3.) What does CreatedBy map to? What does 1 signify? Application or user or other?
4.) Can this table have the same shipmentID multiple times?
5.) Is this table for storing reference numbers?

[Client].[ShipmentStop]
1.) Can this table have the same shipment mulitple times?
2.) Change AppointmentDate to DATE instead of VARCHAR?
3.) Change AppointmentStart and AppointmentEnd to TIME instead of VARCHAR?
4.) Can city reference a pre existing CityID? Where is the city name coming from? User input or a drop down? Same with state?
5.) Does PostalCode need to be VARCHAR(50)? Perhaps just VARCHAR(10)?
6.) I don't see StopType or StopNumber in in the enviornment but see it in SVN.
7.) What does CreatedBy map to? What does 1 signify? Application or user or other?
8.) LocationType should be a seperate reference table
9.) Why isn't reference data being used for location information? Where is this data coming from?
