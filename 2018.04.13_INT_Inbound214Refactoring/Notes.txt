Stored Procedure - Inbound.ReprocessStatusUpdate
1.) Rewrite query to use one CTE to grab TrackAndTraceID and one CTE to grab StatusUpdateLogId and TrackAndTraceID. Then join on those to grab the rest of the columns from Inbound.TrackAndTrace and Inbound.StatusUpdateLog. (Example can be provided)
2.) Specify INNER JOIN instead of just join
3.) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Inbound_TrackAndTrace_Processed_CreatedDate ON Inbound.TrackAndTrace (Processed, CreatedDate)
4.) CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Inbound_StatusUpdateLog_TrackAndTraceID ON Inbound.StatusUpdateLog (TrackAndTraceID)
5.) Don't need no lock since you have set transaction isolation level read uncommitted
6.) Please add header comments (Created By, Created Date, Created Reason, sample exec)
7.) Do you need to order by TrackAndTraceID? If so, may need to put main select into temp table and then order by TrackAndTraceID on the temp table
