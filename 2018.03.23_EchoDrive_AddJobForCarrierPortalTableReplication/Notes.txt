SSIS - CarrierPortalETL.dtsx

1.) Truncate DB02 Carrier Tables task should execute a SP that truncates the tables instead of having the raw SQL in there.
2.) For the DB02 Data Flow tasks, the settings should be:
Keep identity = check
Table lock = check
Keep nulls = check
Check constraints = no check (no need to check constraints)
Rows per batch = 10,000
Max Insert commit size = 10,000
3.) I don't believe the "Send Email Truncate Fail" is set up correctly because there is no constraint / expression, so it will always send?
4.) For the Event Handler, did you test that it sends an email on failure?
-- 05/03
1.) In the control flow, how will it know if truncation failed? Right now I believe that email will send every time. (Is it getting @Failure from the SP? May need expression.)
2.) Need to configure the dtsConfig files (xml and Excel in the Environment > Template folder)

SQL Job - CarrierPortalETL.sql
